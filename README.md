# Sentiment-Analysis

The goal of the project is to build two different machine learning models for sentiment analysis on the given dataset. The dataset is the Sentiment140 dataset, a publicly available data set created by three graduate students at Stanford University: Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. The two models built are to be compared to see which one performs better.
